# Hand Written Digit Prediction
This project demonstrates a Handwritten Digit Prediction system using the Random Forest Classifier. The dataset consists of 8x8 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits. After visualizing a few sample images, the data is preprocessed by reshaping and scaling the pixel values. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, followed by training a Random Forest Classifier on the training data. The model is evaluated using the test data, and the performance is measured with metrics like confusion matrix and classification report, achieving an accuracy of 98% in predicting the correct digits.
# Financial Market Sentiment Analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on a financial market news dataset containing the top 25 news headlines per day, predicting whether the overall market sentiment is positive (1) or negative (0). The dataset is loaded using pandas, and exploratory analysis reveals 4101 rows and 27 columns (including a date, sentiment label, and 25 news headlines). The headlines are concatenated for each day to form a single text feature. A bag-of-words model is applied using CountVectorizer to convert the text data into numerical features. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets using train_test_split. A RandomForestClassifier with 200 estimators is trained on the data, and the model’s performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The final model achieves an accuracy of 52%, with precision and recall metrics varying between the two sentiment classes.
# Wine Quality Prediction
This project predicts wine quality using Support Vector Machines (SVM), leveraging physicochemical features like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol, and more. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and standardized using StandardScaler for uniformity. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, an SVM classifier is trained to predict wine quality. Grid search and cross-validation are used to optimize hyperparameters such as kernel, C, and gamma. The model is evaluated on test data using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project showcases the application of machine learning in wine quality prediction, aiding winemakers in product assessment.
